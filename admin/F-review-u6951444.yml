comments:
  - Makes great use of helper fucntions/smaller methods to solve more complex problems.
  
  - This approach to coding makes it more efficient as exact actions performed by this methods can be utlized elsewhere. 
  
  - Missing some minor commments on the functionality of methods but not a big issue.
  
  - Only issue with so many methods is an optical mess
  
  - In relation to task 5, isPlacementStringValid - needs optimization as the tests will turn up negative due to time out. (over 1000ms)
 
  - Overall Method + Variable naming is clear and consise while style
  is at an appropriate level.
