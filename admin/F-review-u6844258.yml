comments:
  - The design of code is good since it splits a big question in several methods.
  - Although the code is easy to understand, some necessary comments need to be added and some unnecessary
    comments can be deleted.
  - Some debug code is useful now but it should be deleted in the final version.
  - methods and variables are all properly named and the style is also good for others to read.
